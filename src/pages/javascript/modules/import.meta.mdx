import ExperimentalInline from '../../../components/ExperimentalInline.tsx';

## Syntax

### Value

There's two distinct `import.meta` objects: The object that is referenced in source files
and the object that exists when running the application. Since the value is specific to
individual files, references to `import.meta` are typically replaced during bundling.

For authoring code, bundlers may provide the following properties:

<dl>
  <dt><code>url</code></dt>
  <dd>A reference to the current module that can be used to reference other resources. Often used in combination with the <code>URL</code> constructor.</dd>

  <dt><code>resolve</code></dt>
  <dd>Resolves a given specifier in the context of the current file. Very similar to <code>url</code> but more concise for common use cases.</dd>

  <dt><code>hot</code> <ExperimentalInline /></dt>
  <dd>During development, this may be an object that provides APIs for handling hot replacement. The details of the API are bundler specific.</dd>

  <dt><code>env</code> <ExperimentalInline /></dt>
  <dd>Object that contains custom environment settings, e.g. those read from <code>.env</code> files.</dd>

  <dt><code>env.DEV</code> and <code>env.PROD</code> <ExperimentalInline /></dt>
  <dd>
    <code>env.DEV</code> is a boolean that specifies if development-time debug assertions should be enabled,
    e.g. because the code is running in an interactive development environment.
    It's opposite is <code>env.PROD</code> which should always be equal to <code>!env.DEV</code>.
  </dd>

  <dt><code>env.MODE</code> <ExperimentalInline /></dt>
  <dd>A string description for a "bundling mode". May include any user-defined string.</dd>

  <dt><code>env.SSR</code> <ExperimentalInline /></dt>
  <dd>A boolean that is true if the code is running as part of SSR (server-side rendering).</dd>

  <dt><code>webpack</code>, <code>webpackHot</code>, and <code>webpackContext</code> <ExperimentalInline /></dt>
  <dd>The major version of webpack used to bundle, webpack's hot module replacement API for this module, and contextual information about how this module was included in the current webpack build.</dd>
</dl>
